# SequelizedBurger

Week of 15 Burger 2: The Sequel; using Sequelize
sequelizeBurger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of the burgers they like to eat. When user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page with a button next to it that says "Devour it!". When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page and the app enters a timestamp in the burgers_db.

sequelizeBurger is deployed in Heroku at https://warm-river-53598.herokuapp.com/ This app uses JawsDB Remote Database -JawsDB MySQL.
